## Running locally:
```
npm install
npm start
```

## Creating a new game
TVPARTY provides a few helper methods and events, but it's up to you to build your own games. 

> TIP: Have a look at the example game "Let's drink" for inspiration.

To create a new game:
- 1: Create a new folder in the `/Games` directory to hold your game logic.
- 2: Add any static assets (images etc) to the `/public/assets/[gameName]` folder.
- 3: Add your game to the `/Games/games.js` file to make it available to the app.
- 4: Go wild!

## API

The `GameWrapper` is a higher-order component that will provides the following props and API:

currentPlayer   - (Object)  Current player data
currentPlayerId - (String)  Current player id
socket          - (Object)  Socket.io object (for attaching event listeners)
```

#### Tips:
If you want automatic linting (using prettier), add the prettier ext to your editor and enable `formatOnSave`.

The `/Primitives` folder contains a bunch of useful UI elements you can use. These are built with styled components. You're free to create your own UI and style it however you like.
